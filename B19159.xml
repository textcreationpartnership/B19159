            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS We have found by Our own experience, as well as the information of others, That many Souldiers of Our Army have presumed to sell and pawne their Armes, which with so great difficulty We have provided for the defence of Us and Our Kingdom, and which by Our Military Orders, and Law-Martiall is death, as well to the Receiver and Buyer, as to the Seller. And whereas other of Our Souldiers upon their March have thrown away, or through negligence have lost many of their Armes, and have sold their Horses; We doe hereby require all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whatsoever within this Our County of Oxford, That they hence-forth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume not to buy any Armes whatsoever of any Souldiers in Our Army; and that within foure daies after the publishing this Our Proclamation, they bring and deliver all such Armes of what kind soever, either Muskets, Pikes, Swords, great Saddles, Pistols, Carabines, or the like, which they have so bought or received as aforesaid, to the hands of Our trusty and Well-beloved <hi>Winter Graunt</hi> Esquire, Our Waggon-Master Generall, at <hi>Iohn Robotham's</hi> house in <hi>Granpoole</hi> in Our Citty of <hi>Oxford,</hi> promising them that they shall no waies suffer for what is past, so that they be not hereafter guilty of the same Offence. And We doe farther require every Souldier of Our Army, who hath sold or pawned any of Our Armes whatsoever as aforesaid, That within foure daies after the publishing this Our Proclamation, he informe and acquaint the chief officer of that Regiment wherein he serveth, with the names of such Places and Persons where and to whom he, or any other, to his knowledge, hath sold or pawned any such Armes as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid, promising likewise, That the said Souldier or Souldiers shall no waies suffer for what is past, so that they be not hereafter guilty of the same Offence. And We farther require all Persons whatsoever, who have taken up, or found any Armes left or lost by any Souldiers in Our Army, or any Souldiers of the Army now in Rebellion against Us, or have bought any Horse, Gelding or Mare of any of Our Common-Souldiers, That they henceforward presume not to buy any Horse of what kind soever of any Common-souldier without the consent of the Colonell or chief Officer of the Regiment of which such Souldier is, and that they likewise within foure daies bring and deliver all such Armes and Horses to the said <hi>Winter Graunt,</hi> or his deputies, at the said <hi>Iohn Robotham's</hi> house in Our Citty of <hi>Oxford,</hi> who shall take a note of the names of all such who shall obey Us in these Our commands, and present their names unto Us, that We may take notice of their duty and Affection to Our service. And if a speedy obedience be not given to these Our Commands, We shall give further direction for the searching all Houses where is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble suspition to find any such Armes or Horses. And Our pleasure is, That this Proclamation be read in every Parish Church throughout this County, and in the head of every Regiment in Our Army.</p>
